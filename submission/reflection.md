AI Tools Used

I mainly used ChatGPT throughtout this project. It helped me better understand how to structure my code efficiently, improve readability, and fix logical errors. Additionally, it provided UI design suggestions that enhanced the user expereince of my project. 

Prompting Techniques

I applied iterative prompting, which gradually refining my questions to achieve more precise outputs. I also used role-based prompts to get responses tailored to specific technical or aesthetic needs. This structured prompting approach saved time and improved the accuracy of the responses.

What Worked Well
Iâ€™m proud of the clean and interactive interface I created. The combination of Plotly charts and ipywidgets produced a user-friendly dashboard that dynamically updates weather data. I also managed to maintain a consistent color theme across all components, making the final product both functional and visually appealing.

What Would You Do Differently
If I had more time, I would integrate real-time weather API updates instead of relying on stored data samples. This would make the application more dynamic and realistic. I would also explore adding voice interaction or natural language weather queries to improve accessibility.

Final Thoughts
This project taught me how to combine programming logic with creative UI design. I learned how powerful AI-assisted coding can be when used strategically and how important it is to iterate and test continuously. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that strengthened both my technical and design thinking skills.
